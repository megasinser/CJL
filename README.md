## Introduction

In our project, we are using an Arduino Mega as the microcontroller. It controls a servomotor, ultrasonic sensors, and an Pixy CAM 2.1. The ultrasonic sensors, one on each side of the car and one in the front, indicate to the servomotor when the car needs to turn right or left. The sensor in the front works together with the cam to properly detect obstacles on the track.
